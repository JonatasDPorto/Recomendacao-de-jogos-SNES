It was later released for the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega CD, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear.\nThe plot revolves around biotechnology researcher Kal Morrow and his son Saul. When the former is kidnapped by the evil Chimera organization, Saul uses one of his father's inventions to turn himself into a wolf-human hybrid that may be capable of defeating Chimera.\nWolfchild was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier Switchblade 2, a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating platforms and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/121/2407064/original/wolfchild-video-games-photo-u1?fm=jpg","release_date":"1992","developer":"Core Design","genre":"Platform game, Action game","_id":"2UK1LAEE5LwnnIWZ"}

The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-seconds\", which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\"; special moves that can interrupt combos.\nCritically acclaimed, Killer Instinct was followed by a sequel, the 1996 arcade game Killer Instinct 2, later ported to the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold, as well as a 2013 revival of the franchise as a launch title for Xbox One.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/69/1374026/original/killer-instinct-video-games-photo-u3?fm=jpg","release_date":"1994","developer":"Rare Ltd","genre":"Fighting game","_id":"4WtUXi9t5qZ4NxVw"}

However, this version was only an interpretation of the game, and Dino was unhappy to have his name associated with it, as he was not responsible for any of that version and had no creative control over it. The SNES version features a very different control method, with the ball on sticking to your foot to make running with the ball easier. The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal.

The name was first used in 1967 for a spinoff novel entitled The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½ written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott. The idea of Bond having a nephew was used again in 1991 in an American animated series for television, in which the title character defeats threats to ensure the safety of the free world. The series was mildly successful, spawning a six-volume novelization series by John Peel, a 12-issue comic book series by Marvel Comics published in 1992, and video games for the NES and SNES.\nWhile revolving around the nephew of James Bond, no surviving relatives are mentioned in Fleming’s novels, although he unknowingly conceives a child with former Japanese movie star Kissy Suzuki in You Only Live Twice.\nThe use of \"Jr.\" in the character's name is unusual in that this naming convention is generally reserved for sons, as opposed to nephews and other indirect offspring. Alternatively, it has been proposed that Fleming's James Bond had a brother, also named James Bond, who is the father of James Bond Jr.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/63/1259507/original/james-bond-jr-tv-programs-photo-1?fm=jpg","release_date":"","developer":"","genre":"","_id":"5O4yU1CH19XmkkMT"}

{"id":1719065,"name":"Olympic Summer Games","description":"Olympic Summer Games was the 16-bit edition of the official video game of the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games. It is the third game of a loose \"trilogy\" also consisting of Olympic Gold and Winter Olympics. Overall, it was the last \"Olympic\" video game released for the fourth generation of consoles, as well as the Game Boy.\nIt follows the already common button mashing techniques of previous games, with the usual exceptions.\nIt has 10 events, but only two aren't based on track and field events, and unlike Winter Olympics, there are no major differences between each event on different platforms.\nGraphics are considered to be either worse or only slightly better overall than those of Olympic Gold. While each nation has its own colour set, it was the only redeeming feature. The isometric view on most events meant that most times only grass was visible, and although some backgrounds were animated, on some a few sprites were out of proportion with others; the athlete in the pole vault looks too short when compared to the background objects while in the high jump the opposite occurs.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/86/1719065/original/olympic-summer-games-video-games-photo-1?fm=jpg","release_date":"1996","developer":"Tiertex Design Studios, Black Pearl Software","genre":"Isometric projection, Track and field athletics, Olympic video games, Sports game","_id":"9hyAR7oEMGP1i4Dx"}

This was the first Madden title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay.\nThis was also the first of the Madden games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes.\nDue to an error, the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed. For example, the quarterback for the Jets was #11 while the quarterback for the Giants was #7. This error affected at least the copies for SNES available during the Christmas shopping season of 1993.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/75/1495845/original/madden-nfl-94-video-games-photo-1?fm=jpg","release_date":"1993","developer":"EA Tiburon","genre":"Sports game","_id":"D6VznaeJWDZJCcER"}

As of 12 March 2008, the Civilization franchise has sold more than 8 million copies, according to Take-Two Interactive. There are also several Civilization non-video games.\nAll titles in the series share similar gameplay, centered on building a civilization on a macro-scale from prehistory up to the near future. Each turn allows the player to move his or her units on the map, build or improve new cities and units, and initiate negotiations with the computer-controlled players. In between turns, computer players can do the same. The player will also choose technologies to research. These reflect the cultural, intellectual, and technical sophistication of the civilization, and usually allow the player to build new units or to improve their cities with new structures. In most games in the series, one may win by military conquest, achieving a certain level of culture, building an interstellar space ship, or achieving the highest score, among other means.\nOver the years part of the crew involved in the developing the series became also successful in producing their own strategy games, such as Bruce Shelley of Age of Empires fame, Brian Reynolds who went to create Rise of Nations also received positive accolades and more recently Soren Johnson with Spore.

It introduces new types of the Fatality finishing moves, including Animalities. Other features new to the series were combos, predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks.

The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.\nThe release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football, and hockey.","imageURL":"https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/83/1656137/original/nba-jam-video-games-photo-u3?fm=jpg","release_date":"1993","developer":"Midway Games","genre":"Sports game, Basketball","_id":"jAR9OHX6JxZQst6i"}

When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.\nThe game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels.
